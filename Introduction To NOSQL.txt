INTRODUCTION OF NOSQL DATA BASE:

OVERVIEW OF DATA BASE:
Mongo DB is open source management system that uses DOCUMENT-ORIENTED DATA MODEL:
1.Everything will be interms of Documents
2.each DB has collection, collection is a group of documents(similar topic)
3.collections are similar to tables from the relational model...
4.Document is composed of field and values
5.Documents are stored as JSON Format(JavaScript Object Notation) 
  **Mongo DB actaually stores the JSON documents in a binary-encoded format called BSON
  **BSON extends JSON throught supporting additional data types and to be efficient for 
    encoding and decoding within diffierent languages.
  
  **Browser takes only Java script object
  **Server can understand only JSON format
  
  **JSON is a light weight data exchange format b/w server and brower
  **JS object gets converted to JSON using 
    JSON.STRINGIFY(OBJECT)
  **converting any JSON received into JavaScript Object using 
    JSON.PARSE(JSON)
  **JSON is language Independent.

6.Mongodb consider a Nosql(Not only structured query language)
7.Mongodb don't use relational model(RDBMS), therefore doesn't use SQL as it's 
  query language. 
8.Document-Oriented Model:
  **enables mongodb to store semi-structured data which doesn't require a fixed schema
  **It can achieve this through the use of JSON Document.
  
ADVANTAGE OF NOSQL DB:
1.We can store large data
2.High avaliablility(replica set) and scalability(handling many requests)
3.Horizontal scaling(servers increase--adding multiple servers)
4.No RDMS thereby increasing  the spead
5.Document Object Model made useable and flexiable
6.Rich Query Language(query complexity will be reduced)

Type of Nosql db:
1.Mongo db
2.Cassandera
3.BigTable
4.Raven Db
5.Redis
6.Neo4J
7.Couch Db
8.Hbase
